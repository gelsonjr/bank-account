Bank Account Manager

This program creates bank account objects that can be manipulated.
Objects are added to an ArrayList and can be accessed by searching their account number property:a 4 digit sequence of numbers that can be used as account ID. After the account object is accessed, the user can perform certain operations to the account, such as make deposits,
withdrawals, add interest compound and check the balance
